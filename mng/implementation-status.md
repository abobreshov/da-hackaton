| Workspace | Tests | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@app/auth-service` | 173 | unchanged since M3 |

| **Unit total** | **1531** | +137 since M3 |

## Deferred / debt (post-M4 feature work)

1. **M4 review round** — 5 reviewers (oop-patterns, devils-advocate, system-architect, business-analyst, code-reviewer) + consolidated + critical fixes. Not yet run.
2. **M4 Playwright E2E** — T13 (attachment upload + view), T15 (unread badge + auto-mark-read), T22 (sessions), T27 (PDF-requirement pass) all pending.
3. **Attachments history hydration gap** — `messages.list` + `.since` don't JOIN attachments. Send-ack + WS broadcast carry them, but scrolling history shows body-only. Follow-up: batch `findAttachmentsByMessageIds` in service.
4. **Sessions management FE** — backend writes `user_sessions` on login + revoke endpoint + BFF proxy + FE `/_auth/sessions` route (T23–T26 block). Still uses Redis-only refresh store today.
5. **Design-system refactor** — full Kinetic Playground retheme of UI primitives + responsive breakpoints for chat composer + ManageRoom modal.
6. **M1-era contracts drift backfill** — inline wire-string literals allow-listed in grep-gate (unchanged list from M3).
7. **E2E specs red** — live-stack dependent; M2 + M3 specs need stack up + run for green.
8. **Frontend moderation.ts inviteUser** — return type out-of-sync w/ new BFF `{queued, invited}` shape. FE update pending.
9. **Pre-existing backend messages.controller spec fails** — bigint JSON serialization test mock (unaffected by M4).
10. **Migration 0009/0010 not CONCURRENTLY** — prod day-one lock risk; MVP-safe only.
11. **Dashboard copy-drift tests** — Kinetic Playground redesign broke 3 assertions.
12. **zod 3 → 4 bump** — cascades type breakage across 4 workspaces + `@hookform/resolvers` upgrade. Deferred.
13. **Dependabot** — 12 vulns (10 high + 2 moderate) flagged on origin/master.

## M4 commits (2026-04-20)

- `eb27823` — backend attachments (schema, service, storage, repo, tcp) + unread module + messages `bindAttachments`
- `0fe4a2e` — BFF attachments multipart + RFC 5987 download + `messages.attachmentIds` passthrough
- `35c7fcf` — `message.created` event emit + UnreadSubscriber → `unread.changed` Redis fan-out
- `9917323` — BFF unread endpoints + backend `dmUserId` → `dmId` resolution in unread tcp
- `1046088` — FE unread badges + auto-mark-read + DM peer-keyed counts
- `6a88f19` — FE attachments UI (uploader, paste, inline view, composer integration) + chat.gateway unwrap
- `feacf6f` — Playwright specs: attachment upload round-trip + unread badge round-trip (2 specs; live-stack dependent)
- `9a82aa4` — review fixes: TCP scope XOR, broadcastTarget orphan fallback drop, UnreadSubscriber batched fan-out + self-DM guard, useAutoMarkRead dep-array

## M4 review round — consolidated (5 reviewers: oop-patterns / devils-advocate / system-architect / business-analyst / coderabbit)

### Applied in `9a82aa4`

- Scope-XOR runtime guard on `TcpCmd.attachments.upload` (closes: could persist row with both roomId + dmId).
- `broadcastTarget` orphan fallback dropped — no more `room:orphan` leak vector; malformed upstream = log + skip fan-out.
- `UnreadSubscriber` room fan-out batched at concurrency 16 + self-DM echo guard.
- `useAutoMarkRead` dep array flattened to primitives.

### Deferred to M5 (documented, not fixed)

- **Unread batched SQL** — subscriber still issues N `countSince` queries per room write (concurrency now bounded, but SQL count unchanged). R1 for M5: one SQL returning (userId, count) tuples OR publish bare `unread.bumped` + have FE hydrate.
- **Attachments history hydration** — `messages.list` / `.since` don't JOIN attachments. Send-ack + WS push them, but scroll-back shows body-only. Ship `findAttachmentsByMessageIds` batch → service glue.
- **DM lazy upsert friend/ban gate** — `resolveOrCreateDmChannelId` upserts a `dm_channels` row for any user pair an attacker addresses. Low impact in hackathon demo; add friend/ban check before upsert for hardening.
- **AC-09-03 "1+" vs "99+" text drift** — spec says "1+", FE renders "99+". Reconcile by editing the spec (UI cap matches spec intent).
- **AC-09-07 strict-delta `unread.changed`** — subscriber currently fires on every message.created; AC says "only on count delta". Compare prior vs next before PUBLISH.
- **AC-08-04 comment UI** — DB + API accept `comment` field, but uploader doesn't expose an input.
- **Controller SRP / DTO unification** — `bff/attachments.controller.ts` mixes HTTP + multipart + header encoding; `AttachmentDto` + `BffAttachment` + `AttachmentRow` are three near-identical shapes worth unifying into `@app/contracts`.
- **`<img src>` vs octet-stream UX** — Safari may refuse to render images from `Content-Disposition: attachment` responses. Add a `/attachments/:id/inline` route with `Content-Disposition: inline` + sandbox CSP for known-safe image MIMEs.
- **Attachments paste cap** — composer paste-upload skips the `MAX_FILES_PER_UPLOAD` check (uploader enforces, paste doesn't). Move cap enforcement into `uploadAttachments`.

## M4 pending

1. **T13/T15/T22/T27** — Remaining Playwright E2E: session revoke (T22), PDF-requirement pass (T27). Attachments + unread specs landed in `feacf6f`.
2. **T23–T26** — sessions DB writer on login, backend TCP `sessions.listForUser`/`.revoke`, BFF `/sessions` endpoints, FE `/_auth/sessions` route.
3. **T28–T32** — polish: Kinetic Playground token audit, responsive breakpoints, emoji picker, `moderation.ts inviteUser` shape fix, dashboard copy-drift tests.

## M5 candidates (reviewer-ready)

1. **Load test harness** — k6 / artillery scripts for 300 concurrent × 1000 members × 6 msg/s; measure p95 msg delivery + presence propagation.
2. **Retention prune verification** — run against seeded 10k-msg room; check non-blocking + batch sizing.
3. **Dependabot cleanup** — resolve 12 flagged vulns.
4. **Migration 0009/0010 rewrite CONCURRENTLY** — prod-safe variant.
5. **Observability** — Dozzle + Prometheus/Loki scaffolding for demo dashboards.
6. **README.md + mng/README.md demo walkthrough refresh**.
7. **E2E green** against live stack — confirm M2 + M3 specs all pass.

## ADR index

- **ADR-001** — Presence source of truth: EPIC-02 owns state + DB writes; EPIC-03 `PresencePublisher` primitive; EPIC-09 observer only.
- **ADR-002** — Async account-delete cascade: auth-service → backend TCP `users.cascade.enqueue` → BullMQ `user.cascade.delete`; consumer EPIC-11.
- **ADR-003** — WS handshake auth: cookie-only MVP (same-origin BFF). No session-ticket endpoint. Cross-origin POST-MVP.
- **ADR-004** — Message fan-out: Socket.IO room + @socket.io/redis-adapter (`io.to('room:'+id).emit`). Presence keeps explicit interest-graph subscriber (different semantics).
- **ADR-005** — Invite username enumeration: BFF `resolveUserIdByUsername` returns `{queued:true, invited:null}` on miss (fail-silent). Rate-limit via AC-14-13 friend-req bucket. Prevents auth'd users probing directory via invite API.
- **ADR-006** — Message fan-out scaling envelope: 300 concurrent × 1000 members/room × 6 msg/s = 6000 socket-emits/s/room. @socket.io/redis-adapter stream-per-room default. Re-visit if p99 > 250ms or hot rooms > 10. Resharding trigger: Redis aggregate > 50k msg/s.
